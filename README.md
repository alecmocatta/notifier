[Docs](https://docs.rs/notifier/0.1.1)

A wrapper around platform event notification APIs (currently via [mio](https://github.com/carllerche/mio)) that can also handle high-resolution timer events, including those set (on another thread) *during* a `notifier.wait()` call.

Delivers **edge-triggered** notifications for file descriptor state changes (corresponding to `mio::Ready::readable() | mio::Ready::writable() | mio::unix::UnixReady::hup() | mio::unix::UnixReady::error()`) as well as elapsing of instants.

It's designed to be used in conjunction with a library that exhaustively collects events (e.g. connected, data in, data available to be written, remote closed, bytes acked, connection errors) upon each edge-triggered notification â€“ for example [`tcp_typed`](https://github.com/alecmocatta/tcp_typed).

## Note

Currently doesn't support Windows.
